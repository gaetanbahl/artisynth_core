ArtiSynth Notes:
   
FemModel
   particleDamping vs. massDamping vs. pointDamping

FemElement3d
   density?  Get's confusing and inconsistent
   Setting FemNode3d's mass and then varying density over-write each other
   
FemNode3d
   pointDamping: is it even used?  seems like value taken from particleDamping
                 in FemModel3d.updateNodeForces
                 Should it be removed?

   setRestPosition(...) notify fem so that if need be it can invalidate
                 nodal rest volumes.
                 <maybe should use better method>


TrackingController
   Remove PID stuff, make a new controller
   Excessive object references, e.g. myRegularizationTerm (forced to be L2RegularizationTerm?)

FemMaterial
   computeStress(...)  is it actually computeStrain(...)?
