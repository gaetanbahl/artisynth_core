Second, it looks like setting selection color behaves differently
under GL2 and GL3. In GL3, it simply overlays the "diffuse" color of
the current material with the selection color. In GL2, it seems to
replace the entrire material with the contents of the
selectionMaterial. The GL3 behavior I think makes more sense.

Finally, do we want to provide methods for synchronizing state around
custom GL calls in GL2Viewer? At present, you call maybeUpdateState()
in getG2(), but we also need a way to re-update the state based on
whatever the custom calls have done (assuming that's possible).
So something like this might be appropriate:

   viewer.beginCustomGL();

   ... custom GL calls ...

   viewer.endCustomGL();


GL Rendering Woes
----------------------------

In PolygonalMeshDemo:
---------------------

8) With GL2 or GL3, we need the ability to disable vertex coloring so we
can render edges on top of vertex-colored faces.

2D Rendering (Antonio)
----------------------

Transparency and face sorting (No action currently needed)
----------------------------------------------------------

The best place to handle face sorting is in the renderer itself,
although this is hard to do with GL. The existing face sorting in
PolygonalMesh will be kept, but not incorporated into
prerender()/render() unless a specific need arises.
