\section{Finite Element Models}
\label{FEMModels:sec}

This section details how to construct three-dimensional finite element models,
and how to couple them with the other simulation components described in
previous sections (e.g.~particles and rigid bodies).  Finite element
\emph{muscles}, which have additional properties that allow them to contract
given activation signals, are discussed in Section \ref{sec:fem:muscle}.  An 
example FEM model of the masseter, coupled to a rigid jaw and maxilla, is shown 
in Figure \ref{fig:fem:masseter}.

\subsection{Overview}
\label{sec:fem:overview}

The finite element method (FEM) is a numerical technique used for solving a 
system of partial differential equations (PDEs) over some domain.  The general
approach is to divide the domain into a set of building blocks, referred to
as \emph{elements}.  These partition the space, and form local domains over
which the system of equations can be locally approximated. The corners of these
elements, the \emph{nodes}, become control points in a discretized system.  
The solution is then assumed to be
smoothly interpolated across the elements based on values determined at the
nodes.  Using this discretization, the differential system is converted into 
an algebraic one, which is often linearized and iteratively solved.

In ArtiSynth, the PDEs considered are the governing equations of
continuum mechanics: the conservation of mass, momentum and energy.  To 
complete the system, a \emph{constitutive equation} is required that describes
the stress-strain response of the material.  This constitutive equation is what
disguishes between material types.  The domain is the three-dimensional space
that the model occupies. This must be divided into small elements which 
accurately represent the geometry. Within each element, the PDEs are
sampled at a set of points, referred to as \emph{integration points}, and 
terms are numerically integrated to form an algebraic system to solve.

The purpose of the rest of this section is to describe the construction and
use of finite elements models within ArtiSynth.  It does not further discuss 
the mathematical framework or theory.
For an in-depth coverage of the nonlinear finite element method, as applied
to continuum mechanics, the reader is referred to the textbook by Bonet and 
Wood \cite{bonet:fem:2000}.

\subsubsection{FemModel3d}
\label{sec:fem:structure}

The basic type of finite element model is implemented in the class 
\javaclass[artisynth.core.femmodels]{FemModel3d}.  This class controls some
properties that are used by the model as a whole.  The key ones that affect
simulation dynamics are:
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{|ll|}
		\hline
		Property & Description\\
		\hline
		{\tt density} & The density of the model\\
		{\tt material} & An object that describes the material's 
		    \emph{constitutive law} (i.e.~its stress-strain relationship).\\
		{\tt particleDamping} & Proportional damping associated with the 
		    particle-like motion of the FEM nodes.\\
		{\tt stiffnessDamping} & Proportional damping associated with the 
		    system's stiffness term.\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}
These properties can be set and retrieved using the methods
\begin{lstlisting}[]
	setDensity ( double density );    // sets the density
	double getDensity ();             // gets the density

	setMaterial ( FemMaterial mat );  // sets the FEM's material
	FemMaterial getMaterial ();       // gets the FEM's material

	setParticleDamping ( double d );  // sets the particle (mass) damping coefficient
	double getParticleDamping ();     // gets the particle (mass) damping coefficient

	setStiffnessDamping ( double d ); // sets the stiffness damping coefficient
	double getStiffnessDamping ( );   // gets the stiffness damping coefficient
\end{lstlisting}
Keep in mind that ArtiSynth is essentially ``unitless'' (Section 
\ref{sec:mechii:units}), so it is the responsibility of the developer to
ensure that all properties are specified in a compatible way.  

The density of the model is used to compute the mass distribution throughout
the model.  Note that we use a \emph{diagonally lumped mass matrix} (DLMM)
formulation, so the mass is assumed to be concentrated at the location of
the discritized FEM nodes.  To allow for a spatially-varying density,
a mass can later be specified for each node individually.

The FEM's {\tt material} is a delegate object used to compute stress and 
stiffness within individual elements.  It handles the \emph{constitutive}
component of the model.  Materials will be discussed in more detail in
Section \ref{sec:fem:materials}.

The two damping parameters are related to \emph{Rayleigh damping}, which
is used to dissipate energy within finite element models.  There are two 
proportional damping terms: one related to the system's mass, and one related 
to stiffness.  The resulting damping force applied is
\begin{align}
	\f_d & = - (d_M \M + d_K\K)\v,
\end{align}
where $d_M$ is the value of {\tt particleDamping}, $d_K$ is the value of 
{\tt stiffnessDamping}, $\M$ is the FEM model's lumped mass matrix, $\K$ is 
the FEM's stiffness matrix, and $\v$ is the concatenated vector of FEM node
velocities.  Since the lumped mass matrix is diagonal, the mass-related
component of damping can be applied separately to each FEM node.  Thus, the
mass component reduces to the same system as Equation \eqref{eqn:pointdamping},
which is why it is referred to as ``particle damping''.

\subsubsection{Component Structure}

Each \javaclass[artisynth.core.femmodels]{FemModel3d} contains three 
lists of sub-components:

\begin{description}
\item[Nodes]\mbox{}

The particle-like dynamic components of the model.  These lie at the corners
of the elements and carry all the mass (due to DLMM formulation).

\item[Elements]\mbox{}

The spatial building blocks of the model.  These define the sub-units over 
which the system is numerically integrated.

\item[Meshes]\mbox{}

The geometry in the model.  This includes the surface mesh, and any other
embedded geometries.
\end{description}

An example showing each of these components is shown in Figure \ref{fig:fem}.

	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Sub-components of \javaclass[artisynth.core.femmodels]{FemModel3d}. \label{fig:fem}}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Nodes}
\ifLaTeXML{\newline}

Finite element nodes are implemented in the class 
\javaclass[artisynth.core.femmodels]{FemNode3d}, which is a subclass of 
\javaclass[artisynth.core.mechmodels]{Particle} (Section 
\ref{ParticlesAndSprings:sec}).  They are the main dynamic components of
the finite element model.  The key properties affecting simulation dynamics
are:
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{|ll|}
		\hline
		Property & Description\\
		\hline
		{\tt restPosition} & The initial position of the node.\\
		{\tt position} & The current position of the node.\\
		{\tt velocity} & The current velocity of the node.\\
		{\tt mass} & The mass of the node.\\
		{\tt dynamic} & Whether the node is considered dynamic or parametric 
		                (e.g.~boundary condition).\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Each of these properties has corresponding {\tt getXxx()} and 
{\tt setXxx(...)} functions to access and modify them.

The {\tt restPosition} property defines the node's position in the FEM model's 
``natural'' or ``undeformed'' state.  Rest positions are used to compute
an initial configuration for the model, from which strains are determined.  A
node's rest position can be updated in code using the method:
\javamethod[artisynth.core.femmodels]{FemNode3d.setRestPosition(Point3d)}.

\begin{sideblock}
If any node's rest positions are changed, the current values 
for stress and stiffness will become invalid.  They can be manually
updated using the method \javamethod[artisynth.core.femmodels] %
{FemModel3d.updateStressAndStiffness()} for the parent model. Otherwise,
stress and stiffness will be automatically updated at the beginning of the 
next time step. 
\end{sideblock}

The properties {\tt position} and {\tt velocity} give the node's current
3D state.  These are common to all point-like particles, as is the 
{\tt mass} property.  Here, however, {\tt mass} represents the lumped mass
of the immediately surrounding material.  Its value is initialized by equally
dividing mass contributions from each adjacent element, given their
densities.  For a finer control of spatially-varying densities,
node masses can be set manually after FEM creation.

The FEM node's {\tt dynamic} property specifies whether or not the 
node is considered when computing the dynamics of the system.  If not,
it is treated as being parametrically controlled.  This has implications
when setting boundary conditions (Section \ref{sec:fem:boundary}).

\paragraph{Elements}
\ifLaTeXML{\newline}

Elements are the spatial building blocks of the domain.  Within each element,
the displacement (or strain) field is interpolated from displacements at nodes:
\begin{align}
	\u(\x) & = \sum_{i=1}^N \phi_i(\x)\u_i, \label{eqn:fem:interp}
\end{align}
where $\u_i$ is the displacement of the $i$th node that is adjacent to the 
element, and $\phi_i(\cdot)$ is referred to as the \emph{shape function} (or 
\emph{basis function}) associated with that node.  Elements are classified by 
their shape, number of nodes, and shape function order (Table 
\ref{tbl:fem:elements}).  ArtiSynth supports the following element types:
\begin{center}
	\setlengthLaTeXML{\imglength}{1.5in}{1in}
	\begin{tabular}{c@{\hspace{5ex}}c@{\hspace{5ex}}c@{\hspace{5ex}}c}
		\includegraphics[height=\imglength]{images/fem_element_tet} &
		\includegraphics[height=\imglength]{images/fem_element_pyramid} &
		\includegraphics[height=\imglength]{images/fem_element_wedge} &
		\includegraphics[height=\imglength]{images/fem_element_hex} \\
		\javaclass[artisynth.core.femmodels]{TetElement}, &
		\javaclass[artisynth.core.femmodels]{PyramidElement}, & 
		\javaclass[artisynth.core.femmodels]{WedgeElement}, &
		\javaclass[artisynth.core.femmodels]{HexElement},\\
		\javaclass[artisynth.core.femmodels]{QuadtetElement} &
		\javaclass[artisynth.core.femmodels]{QuadpyramidElement} & 
		\javaclass[artisynth.core.femmodels]{QuadwedgeElement} &
		\javaclass[artisynth.core.femmodels]{QuadhexElement}
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}
The base class for all of these is \javaclass[artisynth.core.femmodels]%
{FemElement3d}.  A numerical integration is performed within each element
to create the (tangent) stiffness matrix.  This integration is performed
by evaluating the stress and stiffness at a set of \emph{integration points}
within each element, and applying numerical quadrature.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\caption{Supported element types \label{tbl:fem:elements}}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
	\hline\hline
	Element Type & \# Nodes & Order &  \# Integration Points \\
	\hline
	\javaclass[artisynth.core.femmodels]{TetElement} & 4 & linear & 1\\
	\javaclass[artisynth.core.femmodels]{PyramidElement} & 5 & linear & 5\\
	\javaclass[artisynth.core.femmodels]{WedgeElement} & 6 & linear & 6\\
	\javaclass[artisynth.core.femmodels]{HexElement} & 8 & linear & 8\\
	\javaclass[artisynth.core.femmodels]{QuadtetElement} & 10 & quadratic & 4\\
	\javaclass[artisynth.core.femmodels]{QuadpyramidElement} & 13 & quadratic & 5\\
	\javaclass[artisynth.core.femmodels]{QuadwedgeElement} & 15 & quadratic & 9\\
	\javaclass[artisynth.core.femmodels]{QuadhexElement} & 20 & quadratic & 14\\
	\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

All objects of type \javaclass[artisynth.core.femmodels]{FemModel3d} have the 
following properties:
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{|ll|}
		\hline
		Property & Description\\
		\hline
		{\tt density} & Density of the element\\
		{\tt material} & An object that describes the \emph{constitutive law} 
		                 within the element (i.e.~its stress-strain 
		                 relationship).\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

If left unspecified, the element's {\tt density} is inherited from the 
containing {\tt FemModel3d} object.  When set, the mass of the element is
computed and divided amongst all its nodes, updating the lumped mass
matrix.

Each element's' {\tt material} property is also inherited by default from the 
containing {\tt FemModel3d}. Specifying a material here allows for spatially-
varying material properties across the model.  Materials will be discussed
further in Section \ref{sec:fem:materials}.

\paragraph{Meshes}
\ifLaTeXML{\newline}

A geometry inside a finite element model is a mesh that moves along with the
model.  These geometries can be used for visualizations, or for physical 
interactions like collisions.  However, they have no physical properties 
themselves. All FEM geometries are of type
\javaclass[artisynth.core.femmodels]{FemMesh}, which stores a reference to
a mesh object (Section \ref{Meshes:sec}), and attachment information that
links vertices of the mesh to either FEM nodes or to specific locations inside
containing elements. Creating geometries will be discussed in Section 
\ref{sec:fem:geometry}.

\subsubsection{Materials}
\label{sec:fem:materials}

The stress-strain relationship within each element is defined by a ``material''
delegate object, implemented by a subclass of 
\javaclass[artisynth.core.materials]{FemMaterial}.  This material object is 
responsible for implementing the functions:
%
\begin{lstlisting}[]
   public void computeStress (...)  // computes the symmetric stress tensor
   public void computeTangent (...) // computes the local tangent stiffness matrix
\end{lstlisting}
%
Inputs include a deformation gradient, pressure, and a coordinate frame that
specifies any directions of anisotropy. The default material type is 
\javaclass[artisynth.core.materials]{LinearMaterial}, where stress is related 
to strain through:
\begin{gather}
  \sigma(\x) = D\,\epsilon(\x), \label{eqn:fem:mat:linear}\\
  \text{where }\quad D = \begin{bmatrix}
	  \lambda +2\mu & \lambda & \lambda  & 0 & 0 & 0\\
	  \lambda &  \lambda +2\mu & \lambda & 0 & 0 & 0\\
	  \lambda & \lambda & \lambda +2\mu & 0 & 0 & 0\\
	  0 & 0 & 0 & \mu & 0 & 0\\
	  0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \mu & 0\\
	  0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \mu
        \end{bmatrix}, \quad \lambda = \dfrac{E\nu}{(1+\nu)(1-2\nu)},  \quad
      \mu = \dfrac{E}{2(1+\nu)},\notag
\end{gather}
$\sigma$ is the standard $6\times 1$ stress vector, $\epsilon$ is the 
strain vector, $E$ is the Young's Modulus, and $\nu$ is Poisson's ratio. This
linear material uses a corotational formulation, so rotations are removed
per element before computing the strain \cite{ngan:fem:2008}.  To enable or
disable this corotational formaulation, use 
\javamethod[artisynth.core.materials]{LinearMaterial.setCorotated(boolean)}.

Other, non-linear, models are available in the package  
{\tt artisynth.core.materials}.  A list of common materials is provided in 
Table \ref{tbl:fem:materials}.  Those that are subclasses of 
\javaclass[artisynth.core.materials]{IncompressibleMaterial} allow for 
incompressibility.

\begin{table}[ht]
	\centering
 	\caption{Commonly used FEM materials \label{tbl:fem:materials}}
 	\begin{tabular}{|lll|}
 		\hline
 		\hline
 		Material & Parameters & \\
 		\hline
 		\javaclass[artisynth.core.materials]{LinearMaterial} & $E$ & Young's modulus \\
 		& $\nu$ & Poisson's ratio\\
 		& corotated & corotational formulation\\
 		\hline
 		\javaclass[artisynth.core.materials]{StVenantKirchoffMaterial} & $E$ & Young's modulus\\
 		& $\nu$ & Poisson's ratio\\
 		\hline
 		\javaclass[artisynth.core.materials]{NeoHookeanMaterial} & $E$ & Young's modulus\\
 		& $\nu$ & Poisson's ratio\\
 		\hline
 		\javaclass[artisynth.core.materials]{IncompressibleNeoHookeanMaterial} & $G$ & shear modulus\\
 		& $\kappa$ & bulk modulus\\
 		\hline
 		\javaclass[artisynth.core.materials]{MooneyRivlinMaterial} & $C_{10},C_{01},C_{20},C_{02}$ & distortional parameters\\
 		& $\kappa$ & bulk modulus\\
 		\hline
 		\javaclass[artisynth.core.materials]{OgdenMaterial} & $\mu_1,\ldots,\mu_6$ & material parameters\\
 		& $\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_6$ &\\
 		& $\kappa$ & bulk modulus\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\subsubsection{Boundary conditions}
\label{sec:fem:boundary}

Boundary conditions can be implemented in one of several ways:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Explicitly setting FEM node positions/velocities
	\item Attaching FEM nodes to other dynamic components
	\item Enabling collisions
\end{enumerate}
To enforce an explicit (Dirichlet) boundary condition for a set of  
nodes, their {\tt dynamic} property must be set to {\tt false}.  This notifies
ArtiSynth that the state of these nodes (both position and velocity) will 
be controlled parametrically.  By disabling dynamics, a fixed 
boundary condition is applied.  For a moving boundary, positions and velocities 
of the boundary nodes need to be explicitly set every timestep.  This can be 
accomplished with either a \javaclass[artisynth.core.modelbase]{Controller} 
(Section \ref{ControllersAndMonitors:sec}) or an 
\javaclass[artisynth.core.probes]{InputProbe} (Section \ref{Probes:sec}).
Note that both the position \emph{and} velocity of the nodes should be
explicitly set for consistency.

Another type of supported boundary condition is to attach FEM nodes to other
components, including particles, springs, rigid bodies, and locations within
other FEM elements.  Here, the node is still considered dynamic, but its
motion is coupled to that of the attached component through a constraint
mechanism. Attachments will be discussed further in Section 
\ref{sec:fem:nodeattachments}.

Finally, the boundary of a FEM can be constrained by enabling collisions
with other components.  This will be covered in Section
\ref{sec:fem:collision}.


\subsection{FEM model creation}

Creating a finite element model in ArtiSynth typically follows the pattern:
\begin{lstlisting}[]
   // Create and add main MechModel
   MechModel mech = new MechModel("mech");
   addModel(mech);
      
   // Create FEM
   FemModel3d fem = new FemModel3d("fem");
   
   /* ... Setup FEM structure and properties ... */
   
   // Add FEM to model
   mech.addModel(fem); 
\end{lstlisting}
The main code block for the FEM setup should do the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\setlength{\itemsep}{-0.3em}
	\item Build the node/element structure
	\item Set physical properties%
	\ifLaTeXMLelse{}{\vspace{-0.5em}}
	\begin{itemize}
		\setlength{\itemsep}{-0.3em}
		\item density
		\item damping
		\item material
	\end{itemize} 
	\item Set boundary conditions
	\item Set render properties
\end{itemize}
Building the FEM structure can be done with the use of factory
methods for simple shapes, by loading external files, or by writing code
to manually assemble the nodes and elements.

\subsubsection{Factory methods}

For simple shapes such as beams and ellipsoids, there are factory methods to 
automatically build the node and element structure.  These methods are found
in the \javaclass[artisynth.core.femmodels]{FemFactory} class.  Some common
methods are
\begin{lstlisting}[]
FemFactory.createGrid(...)          // basic beam
FemFactory.createCylinder(...)      // cylinder
FemFactory.createTube(...)          // hollowed cylinder
FemFactory.createEllipsoid(...)     // ellipsoid
FemFactory.createTorus(...)         // torus
\end{lstlisting}
The inputs specify the dimensions, resolution, and potentially the type
of element to use.  The following code creates a basic beam made up of
hexahedral elements:
\begin{lstlisting}[]
// Create FEM
FemModel3d beam = new FemModel3d("beam");
      
// Build FEM structure
double[] size = {1.0, 0.25, 0.25};  // widths
int[] res = {8, 2, 2};              // resolution (# elements)
      
FemFactory.createGrid(beam, FemElementType.Hex,
	size[0], size[1], size[2], 
	res[0], res[1], res[2]);

/* ... Set FEM properties ... */

// Add FEM to model
mech.addModel(beam);
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Loading external FEM meshes}

For more complex geometries, volumetric meshes can be loaded from external
files.  A list of supported file types is provided in Table 
\ref{tbl:fem:fileformats}. To load a geometry, an appropriate file reader
must be created.  Readers capable of reading FEM models implement the 
interface \javaclass[artisynth.core.femmodels]{FemReader}, which has the
method
\begin{lstlisting}[]
readFem( FemModel3d fem )   // populates the FEM based on file contents
\end{lstlisting}
Additionally, many {\tt FemReader} classes have static methods to handle
the loading of files for convenience.

\begin{table}[ht]
	\centering
	\caption{Supported FEM geometry files \label{tbl:fem:fileformats}}
	\begin{tabular}{llll}
		\hline\hline
		Format & File extensions & Reader & Writer\\
		\hline
		ANSYS & .node, .elem & \javaclass[artisynth.core.femmodels]{AnsysReader} & \javaclass[artisynth.core.femmodels]{AnsysWriter}\\
		TetGen & .node, .ele & \javaclass[artisynth.core.femmodels]{TetGenReader} & \javaclass[artisynth.core.femmodels]{TetGenWriter}\\
		Abaqus & .inp & \javaclass[artisynth.core.femmodels]{AbaqusReader} & \javaclass[artisynth.core.femmodels]{AbaqusWriter}\\
		VTK (ASCII) & .vtk & \javaclass[artisynth.core.femmodels]{VtkAsciiReader} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{--}\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The following code snippet demonstrates how to load a model using the
\javaclass[artisynth.core.femmodels]{AnsysReader}.
\begin{lstlisting}[]
// Create FEM
FemModel3d tongue = new FemModel3d("tongue");
      
// Read FEM from file
try {
   // Get files relative to THIS class
   String nodeFileName = ArtisynthPath.getSrcRelativePath(this, 
                            "data/tongue.node");
   String elemFileName = ArtisynthPath.getSrcRelativePath(this, 
                            "data/tongue.elem");

   AnsysReader.read(tongue, nodeFileName, elemFileName);

} catch (IOException ioe) {         
   // Wrap error, fail to create model
   throw new RuntimeException("Failed to read model", ioe);
}
      
// Add to model
mech.addModel(tongue);
\end{lstlisting}
The method \javamethod[artisynth.core.util]{ArtisynthPath.getSrcRelativePath()}
is used to find a path within the ArtiSynth source tree that is relative to the
current model's source file.  Note the try-catch block.  Most of these readers 
throw an {tt IOException} if the read fails.

\subsubsection{Generating from surfaces}

There are two ways a FEM model can be generated from a surface: by using a
FEM mesh generator, and by extruding a surface along its normal direction.

ArtiSynth has the ability to interface directly with the TetGen library 
(\href{http://tetgen.org}{http://tetgen.org}) to create a tetrahedral 
volumetric mesh given a closed and manifold surface.  The main java class for
calling TetGen directly is \javaclass[maspack.geometry]{TetgenTesselator}.
The tesselator has several advanced options, allowing for the computation of 
convex hulls, and for adding points to a volumetric mesh.  For simply creating
a FEM from a surface, there is a convenience routine within 
\javaclass[artisynth.core.femmodels]{FemFactory} that handles both mesh 
generation and constructing a {\tt FemModel3d}:
\begin{lstlisting}[]
// Create a FEM from a manifold mesh with a given quality
FemFactory.createFromMesh( PolygonalMesh mesh, double quality );
\end{lstlisting}
If {\tt quality} $>0$, then points will be added in an attempt to bound the
maximum radius-edge ratio (see the {\tt-q} switch for TetGen).  According
to the TetGen documentation, the algorithm \emph{usually} succeeds for a 
quality ratio of 1.2.

It's also possible to create thin layer of elements by extruding a surface
along its normal direction. 
\begin{lstlisting}[]
// Create a FEM by extruding a surface
FemFactory.createExtrusion(
      FemModel3d model, int nLayers, double layerThickness, double zOffset, 
      PolygonalMesh surface);
\end{lstlisting}
For example, to create a two-layer slice of elements centered about a 
surface of a tendon mesh, one might use
\begin{lstlisting}[]
// Load the tendon surface mesh
PolygonalMesh tendonSurface = new PolygonalMesh("tendon.obj");

// Create the tendon
FemModel3d tendon = new FemModel3d("tendon");
int layers = 2;             // 2 layers
double thickness = 0.0005;  // 0.5 mm layer thickness
double offset = thickness;  // center the layers about the surface

// Create the extrusion
FemFactory.createExtrusion( tendon, layers, thickness, offset, tendonSurface );
\end{lstlisting} 
For this type of extrusion, triangular faces become wedge elements, and 
quadrilateral faces become hexahedral elements.  

\begin{sideblock}
Note: for extrusions, no care is taken to ensure element quality; if the 
surface has a high curvature relative to the total extrusion thickness, 
then some elements will be inverted.
\end{sideblock}

\subsubsection{Building elements in code}

A finite element model's structure can also be manually constructed in code.  
\javaclass[artisynth.core.femmodels]{FemModel3d} has the methods:
\begin{lstlisting}[]
addNode ( FemNode3d );       // add a node to the model
addElement ( FemElement3d )  // add an element to the model
\end{lstlisting}
For an element to successfully be added, all its nodes must already have
been added to the model.  Nodes can be constructed from a 3D location, and
elements from an array of nodes.  A convenience routine is available in
\javaclass[artisynth.core.femmodels]{FemElement3d} that automatically creates
the appropriate element type given the number of nodes (Table 
\ref{tbl:fem:elements}):
\begin{lstlisting}[]
// Creates an element using the supplied nodes
FemElement3d FemElement3d.createElement( FemNode3d[] nodes );
\end{lstlisting}
Be aware of node orderings when supplying nodes.  For linear elements, 
ArtiSynth uses a clockwise convention with respect to the outward
normal for the first face, followed by the opposite node(s).  To determine the
correct ordering for a particular element, check the coordinates returned by 
the function 
\javamethod*[artisynth.core.femmodels]{FemElement3d.getNodeCoords()}.
This returns the concatenated coordinate list for an ``ideal'' element of
the given type.

\subsubsection{Example: a simple beam model}

A complete application model that implements a simple FEM beam is given below.
\lstset{numbers=left}
\lstinputlisting{../../src/artisynth/demos/tutorial/FemBeam.java}
\lstset{numbers=none}
This example can be found in {\tt artisynth.demos.tutorial.FemBeam}.  The 
{\tt build()} method first creates a {\tt MechModel} and {\tt FemModel3d}.
A FEM beam is created using a factory method on Line 36.  This beam is
centered at the origin, so its length extends from {\tt-length/2} to 
{\tt length/2}.  The density, damping and material properties are then 
assigned.  

On Lines 45--49, a fixed boundary condition is set to the left-hand side 
of the beam by setting the corresponding nodes to be non-dynamic.  Due to 
numerical precision, a small {\tt EPSILON} buffer is required to ensure 
all left-hand boundary nodes are identified (Line 46).

Rendering properties are then assigned to the FEM model on Line 52.  These 
will be discussed further in Section \ref{sec:fem:rendering}.

Since \javaclass[artisynth.core.femmodels]{FemNode3d} 
is a subclass of \javaclass[artisynth.core.femmodels]{Particle}, it uses the 
same attachment mechanism as that described in Section \ref{Attachments:sec}.
